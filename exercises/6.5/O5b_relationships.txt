# ** EXAM OBJECTIVE: MAPPINGS AND TEXT ANALYSIS **
# GOAL: Model relational data
# REQUIRED SETUP: (i) a running Elasticsearch cluster with at least one node and a Kibana instance, (ii) no index or index template that starts by `hamlet`
# Copy-paste the following instructions into your Kibana console, and work directly from there

# Create the index `hamlet_1` with one primary shard and no replicas
# Add some documents to `hamlet_1` by running the following _bulk command
PUT hamlet_1/_doc/_bulk
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet_1","_id":"C0"}}
{"name":"HAMLET","relationship":[{"name":"HORATIO","type":"friend"},{"name":"GERTRUDE","type":"mother"}]}
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet_1","_id":"C1"}}
{"name":"KING CLAUDIUS","relationship":[{"name":"HAMLET","type":"nephew"}]}
# Verify that the items of the `relationship` array cannot be searched independently - e.g., searching for a friend named Gertrude will return 1 hit
GET hamlet_1/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        { "match": { "relationship.name": "gertrude" } },
        { "match": { "relationship.type": "friend" } }
      ]
    }
  }
}
# Create the index `hamlet_2` with one primary shard and no replicas
# Define a mapping for the default type "_doc" of `hamlet_2`, so that the inner objects of the `relationship` field (i) can be searched independently, (ii) have only unanalyzed fields
# Reindex `hamlet_1` to `hamlet_2`
# Verify that the items of the `relationship` array can now be searched independently - e.g., searching for a friend named Gertrude will return no hits
GET hamlet_2/_search
{
  "query": {
    "nested": {
      "path": "relationship",
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "must": [
            { "match": { "relationship.name": "GERTRUDE" } },
            { "match": { "relationship.type": "friend" } }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
# Add more documents to `hamlet_2` by running the following _bulk command
PUT hamlet_2/_doc/_bulk
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet_2","_id":L0}}
{"line_number":"1.4.1","speaker":"HAMLET","text_entry":"The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold."}
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet_2","_id":L1}}
{"line_number":"1.4.2","speaker":"HORATIO","text_entry":"It is a nipping and an eager air."}
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet_2","_id":L2}}
{"line_number":"1.4.3","speaker":"HAMLET","text_entry":"What hour now?"}
# So far, we have indexed two kinds of documents, either related to characters (ids: C0, C1) or to a line of the dialogue (ids: L0, L1, L2). Notice that a character can have many lines. We will model this one-to-many relation in the next step
# Create the index `hamlet_3` with only one primary shard and no replicas
# Copy the mapping of `hamlet_2` into `hamlet_3`, but also add a join field to define a relation between a `character` (the parent) and a `line` (the child). The name of such field is "character_or_line"
# Reindex `hamlet_2` to `hamlet_3`
# Update the document with id `C0` (i.e., the character document of Hamlet) by adding the field `character_or_line` and setting its `character_or_line.name` value to "character"
# Create a script named `init_lines` and save it into the cluster state. The script (i) has a parameter named `characterId`, (ii) adds the field `character_or_line` to the document, (iii) sets the value of `character_or_line.name` to "line" , (iv) sets the value of `character_or_line.parent` to the value of the `characterId` parameter
# Update the documents in `hamlet_3` that have "HAMLET" as a `speaker`, by running the `init_lines` script with `characterId` set to "C0"
# Note: this was possible because we had only one shard
# Verify that the last operation was successful by running the query below
GET hamlet_3/_search

  "query": {
    "has_parent": {

        }
